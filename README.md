\Finance data project (analyzing the data to predict and analyse stocks)
In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. The data is directly read from Google finance using pandas.
We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.
